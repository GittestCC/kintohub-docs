## Current Release

### 0.1.0

Goal is to get as much feedback as possible on the early UX.  There's already a fair amount of bugs on the backlog for us to tackle, but we wanted to get this out as soon as possible.

#### Known Issues

* Unable to deploy branch that does not have a successful build
* Unable to call services that are deployed via branch (PLEASE DEPLOY TAGGED KINTOBLOCKS ONLY)
* Configuration management is not usable on live yet
* You lose your blocks when you set them to private in your workspace
* gRPC Projects Only - Kintoblock project name must match the {blockname}_block.proto format to detect the gRPC file
* Forgot password, Invitations and Registration Emails are disabled at the moment.
** You can invite people to your workspace via EMAIL only, but the email has to valid and signed up
* New Repo Setup 1st commits always fail
* Sometimes first call takes 10-15 seconds or returns a 503. Try again :).
